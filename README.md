# Oil Level _Supervisor_ - Oil-immersed Power Transformer Oil Level Gas Detection System

## Intro
This project won the **Second Prize (Silver)** in The 8th China International College Students’ “Internet+” Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition back in 2022 during my undergraduate study. In a team of 3 ppl, I was responsible for designing, developing  and testing the software to connect with the hardware (see below) and visualize it.

## Background
Transformers are mainly used worldwide today. Global market sales will reach 10 million dollars in 2021. Sudden and severe failures lead to combustion and explosion—about 10% of transformer failures. Detecting oil surface gas is a key point for timely monitoring transformer operating conditions.
